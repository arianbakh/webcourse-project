# run with 'nodejs server.js'
# view in 'localhost:8888'
# open multiple windows and log in with a different user in each window
# add each user to other users' friends

# NOTES:
# logging in won't require a password, username will suffice
# desktop notifications will ask for your permission the first time
# there is no database but the data on the server will persist as long as the server is running, so you can disconnect a client and log back in and view your friends and chat history
# all avatars are the same (because there is no view to set/change it) but there is a capability to set the avatar in code

# packages: socket.io, express, mongodb (view package.json)
